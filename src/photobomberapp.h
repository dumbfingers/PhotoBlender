/**
 * Photobomber Description: 
 *
 * The PhotoBomber is a camera application that lets you take photos and then have them
 * "bombed" by someone that jumps in, automatically.
 *
 * We use the Camera control from cascades multi-media library. This control needs to be 
 * initiated from C++ code before we can use it though.
 *
 * Feature Summary
 * - Use the Invoke framework to start an application
 * - Register the Camera control from the multi-media library
 * - Connect to the camera's shutter fired signal
